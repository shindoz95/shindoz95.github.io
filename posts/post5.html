        I asked ChatGPT to generate a diaglog where Sollozzo pitches Bitcoin to Don Corleone, and here is what I have:
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: italic;">
Scene: The dimly lit study of Vito Corleone. Sollozzo sits across from the Don, leaning forward, his hands clasped, an air of confidence about him.

Sollozzo: (in a smooth, persuasive tone)
Don Corleone, I come to you with an offer. A revolutionary investment. Not drugs, not gambling—no. This is the future. The currency of tomorrow... Bitcoin.

Vito Corleone: (calmly, leaning back in his chair)
Bitcoin? Hmph. Sounds... exotic. What is this Bitcoin?

Sollozzo: (leaning closer)
Digital gold, Don Corleone. Decentralized. No banks, no middlemen. Just code. It's fast, secure, and untouchable by governments. You invest now, you make a fortune.

Vito Corleone: (narrows his eyes, skeptical)
And who controls this... Bitcoin? Who do I speak to if something goes wrong?

Sollozzo: (smiling slyly)
Nobody, Don. That's the beauty of it. It's a trustless system. Pure math.

Vito Corleone: (his tone sharpens)
Hmm. No control? No guarantees? If I can’t hold it in my hand, it doesn’t exist.

Sollozzo: (laughing lightly)
With respect, Don Corleone, the world is changing. The young—they don’t trust the old ways. They want independence. This... this is the new way to power.

Vito Corleone: (leans forward, his voice dropping to a dangerous calm)
You ask me to put my trust in a... a phantom currency? And in return, you offer what—dreams of riches? Hmph. Bitcoin. No guarantees, no accountability. Tell me, Sollozzo, where is the respect in that?

Sollozzo: (nervously)
Don Corleone, with your influence, you could dominate the crypto world. You'd be untouchable, feared.

Vito Corleone: (pauses, then stands, his tone final)
I’ll make you an offer, Sollozzo. You take this Bitcoin scheme to someone else. Leave my family out of it. My loyalty lies with things I can trust... and respect.

Sollozzo: (realizing his pitch has failed, bows slightly)
As you wish, Don Corleone.

           For some reason that I haven't researched and for some rumors that I haven't investigated, the biden administration seemed to dislike bitcoin and overall crypto currencies.
          These unfavorable regimes for bitcoin is probably really about to change.  
        </p>
        <p>
           Sure, just like the Chip Act and the Build Back Better that Biden proposed and implemented, people know this is coming because the proposals have always been transparent.
         But How many ever prepared for it? Did you buy CAT at 140 or STLD at 30? I guess you didn't.
