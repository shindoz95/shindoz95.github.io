        I asked ChatGPT to generate a diaglog where Sollozzo pitches Bitcoin to Don Corleone, and here is what I have:
        </p>
        <div class="container">
        <h1>Bitcoin Pitch Scene</h1>

        <div class="dialogue">
            <p class="character">Sollozzo:</p>
            <p>Don Corleone, I come to you with an offer. A <em>revolutionary</em> investment. Not drugs, not gambling—no. This is the future. The currency of tomorrow... <strong>Bitcoin</strong>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="dialogue">
            <p class="character">Vito Corleone:</p>
            <p>Bitcoin? Hmph. Sounds... exotic. What is this Bitcoin?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="dialogue">
            <p class="character">Sollozzo:</p>
            <p>Digital gold, Don Corleone. Decentralized. No banks, no middlemen. Just code. It's fast, secure, and untouchable by governments. You invest now, you make a fortune.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="dialogue">
            <p class="character">Vito Corleone:</p>
            <p>And who controls this... Bitcoin? Who do I speak to if something goes wrong?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="dialogue">
            <p class="character">Sollozzo:</p>
            <p><span class="note">(smiling slyly)</span> Nobody, Don. That's the beauty of it. It's a trustless system. Pure math.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="dialogue">
            <p class="character">Vito Corleone:</p>
            <p><span class="note">(his tone sharpens)</span> Hmm. No control? No guarantees? If I can’t hold it in my hand, it doesn’t exist.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="dialogue">
            <p class="character">Sollozzo:</p>
            <p><span class="note">(laughing lightly)</span> With respect, Don Corleone, the world is changing. The young—they don’t trust the old ways. They want independence. This... this is the new way to power.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="dialogue">
            <p class="character">Vito Corleone:</p>
            <p><span class="note">(leans forward, his voice dropping to a dangerous calm)</span> You ask me to put my trust in a... a phantom currency? And in return, you offer what—dreams of riches? Hmph. Bitcoin. No guarantees, no accountability. Tell me, Sollozzo, where is the respect in that?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="dialogue">
            <p class="character">Sollozzo:</p>
            <p><span class="note">(nervously)</span> Don Corleone, with your influence, you could dominate the crypto world. You'd be untouchable, feared.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="dialogue">
            <p class="character">Vito Corleone:</p>
            <p><span class="note">(pauses, then stands, his tone final)</span> I’ll make you an offer, Sollozzo. You take this Bitcoin scheme to someone else. Leave my family out of it. My loyalty lies with things I can trust... and respect.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="dialogue">
            <p class="character">Sollozzo:</p>
            <p><span class="note">(realizing his pitch has failed, bows slightly)</span> As you wish, Don Corleone.</p>
        </div>

           For some reason that I haven't researched and for some rumors that I haven't investigated, the biden administration seemed to dislike bitcoin and overall crypto currencies.
          These unfavorable regimes for bitcoin is probably really about to change.  
        </p>
        <p>
           Sure, just like the Chip Act and the Build Back Better that Biden proposed and implemented, people know this is coming because the proposals have always been transparent.
         But How many ever prepared for it? Did you buy CAT at 140 or STLD at 30? I guess you didn't.
        </p>
        <p>
           Of course, crypto is a harder pitch than either cocaine or industrial stocks because crypto has no intrinsic value. However, there are other elements that should be considered.
        One of which, I shall say, is "Do not underestimate the power of the United States, nor should you underestimate the power of its president."
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">
        How likely will Trump promote crypto? Will his team fully support it?
        </p>
        <p>
           It's the nature of his kind to promote crypto, and it is the nature of his team members, such as Elon Musk and David Sacks, to make the pro-crypto policies steps further.
        The beauty of this dynamic is, you don't know much of the crypto hype yet, but it will very likely go beyond your expectation.
